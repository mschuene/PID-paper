# Overview

This repository contains the source code accompanying the paper
Rauh, J., Schünemann, M., & Jost, J. (2021). Properties of unique information.
In Kybernetika (pp. 383–403). Institute of Information Theory and Automation.
https://doi.org/10.14736/kyb-2021-3-0383

In addition, it contains a matlab fmincon based implementation of the BROJA PID measure
Bertschinger, N., Rauh, J., Olbrich, E., Jost, J., & Ay, N. (2014).
Quantifying unique information. Entropy, 16(4), 2161-2183.

in the file PID.m

The closed form analytical solution for this measure is found in
binary_analytical.m

The faster implementation of the PID optimization problem for the case of binary output variable
based finding optima in the interior via solving a linear program is contained in
Min_MI_X_YZ_binary_T.m

Figure 1 is the paper is reproduced by the script
fig1script.m

and the tables summarizing the statistics of unique/non-unique solutions in the interior/boundary of the
optimization domain were created using the script
statistics_inner_uniqueness.m
and saved in the data/ subdirectory.
